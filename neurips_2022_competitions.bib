                  exoplanetary atmospheres, is an emerging frontier in
                  Planetary Science. To understand the physical
                  properties of hundreds of exoplanets, astronomers
                  have traditionally relied on sampling-based
                  methods. However, with the growing number of
                  exoplanet detections (i.e. increased data quantity)
                  and advancements in technology from telescopes such
                  as JWST and Ariel (i.e. improved data quality),
                  there is a need for more scalable data analysis
                  techniques. The Ariel Data Challenge 2022 aims to
                  find interdisciplinary solutions from the NeurIPS
                  community. Results from the challenge indicate that
                  machine learning (ML) models have the potential to
                  provide quick insights for thousands of planets and
                  millions of atmospheric models. However, the machine
                  learning models are not immune to data drifts, and
                  future research should investigate ways to quantify
                  and mitigate their negative impact.},

  abstract =	 {Solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is an
                  essential task for many industrial
                  applications. Although VRPs have been traditionally
                  studied in the operations research (OR) domain, they
                  have lately been the subject of extensive work in
                  the machine learning (ML) community. Both the OR and
                  ML communities have begun to integrate ML into their
                  methods, but in vastly different ways. While the OR
                  community primarily relies on simplistic ML methods,
                  the ML community generally uses deep learning, but
                  fails to outperform OR baselines. To address this
                  gap, the <em>EURO Meets NeurIPS 2022 Vehicle Routing
                  Competition</em> brought together the OR and ML
                  communities as a joint effort of several previous
                  competitions to solve a challenging VRP variant on
                  real-world data provided by ORTEC, a leading
                  provider of vehicle routing software. The challenge
                  focuses on both a "classic" deterministic VRP with
                  time windows (VRPTW) and a dynamic version in which
                  new orders arrive over the course of a day. Over 50
                  teams submitted solutions over a 13-week submission
                  period, battling for not only the best performance
                  on the competition problems, but also for the
                  longest dominance of the leaderboard. The goals of
                  the competition were achieved, with both
                  state-of-the-art techniques in OR and ML playing a
                  significant role in several of the winning

                  is essential for many real-life applications,
                  especially for industrial settings with high visual
                  diversity, such as waste sorting. In industrial
                  waste sorting, one of the biggest challenges is the
                  extreme diversity of the input stream depending on
                  factors like the location of the sorting facility,
                  the equipment available in the facility, and the
                  time of year, all of which significantly impact the
                  composition and visual appearance of the waste
                  stream. These changes in the data are called
                  ``visual domains'', and label-efficient adaptation
                  of models to such domains is needed for successful
                  semantic segmentation of industrial waste.  To test
                  the abilities of computer vision models on this
                  task, we present the \emph{VisDA 2022 Challenge on
                  Domain Adaptation for Industrial Waste Sorting}.
                  Our challenge incorporates a fully-annotated waste
                  sorting dataset, ZeroWaste, collected from two real
                  material recovery facilities in different locations
                  and seasons, as well as a novel procedurally
                  generated synthetic waste sorting dataset,
                  SynthWaste. In this competition, we aim to answer
                  two questions: 1) can we leverage domain adaptation
                  techniques to minimize the domain gap? and 2) can
                  synthetic data augmentation improve performance on
                  this task and help adapt to changing data
                  distributions? The results of the competition show
                  that industrial waste detection poses a real domain
                  adaptation problem, that domain generalization
                  techniques such as augmentations, ensembling, etc.,
                  improve the overall performance on the unlabeled
                  target domain examples, and that leveraging
                  synthetic data effectively remains an open
                  problem. See \url{https://ai.bu.edu/visda-2022/}},

  abstract =	 {Experimentation on real robots is demanding in terms
                  of time and costs. For this reason, a large part of
                  the reinforcement learning (RL) community uses
                  simulators to develop and benchmark
                  algorithms. However, insights gained in simulation
                  do not necessarily translate to real robots, in
                  particular for tasks involving complex interactions
                  with the environment. The <em>Real Robot Challenge
                  2022</em> therefore served as a bridge between the
                  RL and robotics communities by allowing participants
                  to experiment remotely with a <em>real</em> robot -
                  as easily as in simulation.  In the last years,
                  offline reinforcement learning has matured into a
                  promising paradigm for learning from pre-collected
                  datasets, alleviating the reliance on expensive
                  online interactions. We therefore asked the
                  participants to learn two dexterous manipulation
                  tasks involving pushing, grasping, and in-hand
                  orientation from provided real-robot datasets. An
                  extensive software documentation and an initial
                  stage based on a simulation of the real set-up made
                  the competition particularly accessible. By giving
                  each team plenty of access budget to evaluate their
                  offline-learned policies on a cluster of seven
                  identical real TriFinger platforms, we organized an
                  exciting competition for machine learners and
                  roboticists alike.  In this work we state the rules
                  of the competition, present the methods used by the
                  winning teams and compare their results with a
                  benchmark of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms
                  on the challenge datasets.},

  abstract =	 {The vision of Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is
                  to produce high performing ML pipelines that require
                  very little human involvement or domain expertise to
                  use. Competitions and benchmarks have been critical
                  tools for accelerating progress in AutoML. However,
                  much of the prior work on AutoML competitions has
                  focused on well-studied domains in machine learning
                  such as vision and language---these are domains
                  which have benefited from several years of ML
                  pipeline design by domain experts, which brings the
                  usage of AutoML into question in the first
                  place. Recently, AutoML for diverse tasks has
                  emerged as an important research area that aims to
                  bring AutoML to the domains where it can have the
                  most impact: the long tail of ML tasks <em>beyond
                  vision and language</em>. We present a retrospective
                  report of the AutoML Decathlon---an AutoML for
                  diverse tasks competition hosted at NeurIPS
                  2022. The AutoML Decathlon presented participants
                  with a set of 10 machine learning tasks that are
                  diverse along several axes: domain, input dimension,
                  output dimension, output type, objective function,
                  and scale. Participants were tasked with developing
                  AutoML methods that performed well on a
                  <em>separate</em> set of 10 hidden diverse test
                  tasks within a certain time budget, so as to
                  discourage overfitting to the initial set of tasks
                  and to encourage efficiency. In this report, we
                  outline the details of the competition, discuss the
                  top-5 submissions, analyze the results, and compare
                  top submissions to additional state-of-the-art
                  baselines designed specifically for diverse
                  tasks. We conclude that the combination of existing
                  efficient AutoML techniques with modern advancements
                  in ML such as large-scale transfer learning, modern
                  architectures, and differentiable Neural

                  optimization problem based on its text

                  non-experts to interface with them using natural
                  language. We separate this challenging goal into two
                  sub-tasks: (1) recognize and label the semantic
                  entities that correspond to the components of the
                  optimization problem; (2) generate a meaning
                  representation (i.e. a logical form) of the problem
                  from its detected problem entities. The first task
                  aims to reduce ambiguity by detecting and tagging
                  the entities of the optimization problems. The
                  second task creates an intermediate representation
                  of the linear programming (LP) problem that is
                  converted into a format that can be used by
                  commercial solvers. In this report, we present the

                  critical components for human evolution. The ability
                  to perform movements as simple as holding and
                  rotating an object in the hand without dropping it
                  needs the coordination of more than 35 muscles which
                  act synergistically or antagonistically on multiple
                  joints. This complexity in control is markedly
                  different from typical pre-specified movements or
                  torque based controls used in robotics. In the
                  MyoChallenge at the NeurIPS 2022 competition track,
                  we challenged the community to develop controllers
                  for a realistic hand to solve a series of dexterous
                  manipulation tasks. The MyoSuite framework was used

                  neuromusculoskeletal model of the hand and

                  and a boading ball (rotation of two spheres respect
                  to each other) tasks. More than 40 teams
                  participated to the challenge and submitted more
                  than 340 solutions. The challenge was split in two
                  phases. In the first phase, where a limited set of
                  objectives and randomization were proposed, teams
                  managed to achieve high performance, in particular
                  in the boading-ball task.  In the second phase as
                  the focus shifted towards generalization of task
                  solutions to extensive variations of object and task
                  properties, teams saw significant performance
                  drop. This shows that there is still a large gap in
                  developing agents capable of generalizable skilled
                  manipulation. In future challenges, we will continue

  abstract =	 {The global trends of urbanization and increased
                  personal mobility force us to rethink the way we
                  live and use urban space. The Traffic4cast
                  competition series tackles this problem in a
                  data-driven way, advancing the latest methods in
                  machine learning for modeling complex spatial
                  systems over time. In this edition, our dynamic road
                  graph data combine information from road maps,
                  $10^{12}$ probe data points, and stationary vehicle
                  detectors in three cities over the span of two
                  years. While stationary vehicle detectors are the
                  most accurate way to capture traffic volume, they
                  are only available in few locations.  Traffic4cast
                  2022 explores models that have the ability to
                  generalize loosely related temporal vertex data on
                  just a few nodes to predict dynamic future traffic
                  states on the edges of the entire road graph.  In
                  the core challenge, participants are invited to
                  predict the likelihoods of three congestion classes
                  derived from the speed levels in the GPS data for
                  the entire road graph in three cities 15~min into
                  the future. We only provide vehicle count data from
                  spatially sparse stationary vehicle detectors in
                  these three cities as model input for this task. The
                  data are aggregated in 15~min time bins for one hour
                  prior to the prediction time. For the extended
                  challenge, participants are tasked to predict the
                  average travel times on super-segments 15~min into
                  the future -- super-segments are longer sequences of
                  road segments in the graph.  The competition results
                  provide an important advance in the prediction of
                  complex city-wide traffic states just from publicly
                  available sparse vehicle data and without the need
                  for large amounts of real-time floating vehicle
                  data.},

                  systems with hidden behavior that lies dormant until
                  activated. In recent years, trojan detection has
                  emerged as a promising avenue for defending against
                  standard trojan attacks. However, there have been
                  few investigations on trojans specifically designed
                  to be difficult to detect. We organized the Trojan
                  Detection Challenge to begin work on the important
                  question of how to build more robust trojan
                  detectors. This paper gives an overview of the
                  competition and its results. Notably, participants
                  greatly improved over strong baselines on trojan
                  detection and reverse-engineering tasks,
                  demonstrating the potential for proactively
                  improving the robustness of trojan detectors. We
                  hope the competition and its results will inspire
                  further research in detecting hidden behavior in
                  machine learning systems.},

                  and machine learning through a highly topical
                  interdisciplinary competition challenge: The
                  prediction of hi-res rain radar movies from
                  multi-band satellite sensors, requiring data fusion,
                  multi-channel video frame prediction, and
                  super-resolution. Accurate predictions of rain
                  events are becoming ever more critical, with climate
                  change increasing the frequency of unexpected
                  rainfall. The resulting models will have a
                  particular impact where costly weather radar is not
                  available. We here present highlights and insights
                  emerging from the thirty teams participating from
                  over a dozen countries.  To extract relevant
                  patterns, models were challenged by spatio-temporal
                  shifts.  Geometric data augmentation and test-time
                  ensemble models with a suitable smoother loss helped
                  this transfer learning. Even though, in ablation,
                  static information like geographical location and
                  elevation was not linked to performance, the general
                  success of models incorporating physics in this
                  competition suggests that approaches combining
                  machine learning with application domain knowledge
                  seem a promising avenue for future research.

                  benchmark reference data set introduced here,
                  advancing competition tasks to quantitative
                  predictions, and exploring the effects of metric
                  choice on model performance and qualitative

  abstract =	 {The neural underpinning of the biological visual
                  system is challenging to study experimentally, in
                  particular as neuronal activity becomes increasingly
                  nonlinear with respect to visual input. Artificial
                  neural networks (ANNs) can serve a variety of goals
                  for improving our understanding of this complex
                  system, not only serving as predictive digital twins
                  of sensory cortex for novel hypothesis generation in
                  silico, but also incorporating bio-inspired
                  architectural motifs to progressively bridge the gap
                  between biological and machine vision. The mouse has
                  recently emerged as a popular model system to study
                  visual information processing, but no standardized
                  large-scale benchmark to identify state-of-the-art
                  models of the mouse visual system has been
                  established. To fill this gap, we proposed the
                  SENSORIUM benchmark competition. We collected a
                  large-scale dataset from mouse primary visual cortex
                  containing the responses of more than 28,000 neurons
                  across seven mice stimulated with thousands of
                  natural images, together with simultaneous
                  behavioral measurements that include running speed,
                  pupil dilation, and eye movements. The benchmark
                  challenge ranked models based on predictive
                  performance for neuronal responses on a held-out
                  test set, and included two tracks for model input
                  limited to either stimulus only (SENSORIUM) or
                  stimulus plus behavior (SENSORIUM+). As a part of
                  the NeurIPS 2022 competition track, we received 172
                  model submissions from 26 teams, with the winning
                  teams improving our previous state-of-the-art model
                  by more than 15 percent. Dataset access and
                  infrastructure for evaluation of model predictions
                  will remain online as an ongoing benchmark. We would
                  like to see this as a starting point for regular
                  challenges and data releases, and as a standard tool
                  for measuring progress in large-scale neural system
                  identification models of the mouse visual system and
                  beyond.},
