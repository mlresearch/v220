title: Lessons Learned from Ariel Data Challenge 2022 - Inferring Physical Properties
  of Exoplanets From Next-Generation Telescopes
abstract: Exo-atmospheric studies, i.e. the study of exoplanetary atmospheres, is
  an emerging frontier in Planetary Science. To understand the physical properties
  of hundreds of exoplanets, astronomers have traditionally relied on sampling-based
  methods. However, with the growing number of exoplanet detections (i.e. increased
  data quantity) and advancements in technology from telescopes such as JWST and Ariel
  (i.e. improved data quality), there is a need for more scalable data analysis techniques.
  The Ariel Data Challenge 2022 aims to find interdisciplinary solutions from the
  NeurIPS community. Results from the challenge indicate that machine learning (ML)
  models have the potential to provide quick insights for thousands of planets and
  millions of atmospheric models. However, the machine learning models are not immune
  to data drifts, and future research should investigate ways to quantify and mitigate
  their negative impact.
