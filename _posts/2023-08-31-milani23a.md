title: 'Towards Solving Fuzzy Tasks with Human Feedback: A Retrospective of the MineRL
  BASALT 2022 Competition'
abstract: To facilitate research in the direction of fine-tuning foundation models
  from human feedback, we held the MineRL BASALT Competition on Fine-Tuning from Human
  Feedback at NeurIPS 2022. The BASALT challenge asks teams to compete to develop
  algorithms to solve tasks with hard-to-specify reward functions in Minecraft. Through
  this competition, we aimed to promote the development of algorithms that use human
  feedback as channels to learn the desired behavior. We describe the competition
  and provide an overview of the top solutions. We conclude by discussing the impact
  of the competition and future directions for improvement.
