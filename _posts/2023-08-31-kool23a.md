title: The EURO Meets NeurIPS 2022 Vehicle Routing Competition
abstract: Solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is an essential task for many industrial
  applications. Although VRPs have been traditionally studied in the operations research
  (OR) domain, they have lately been the subject of extensive work in the machine
  learning (ML) community. Both the OR and ML communities have begun to integrate
  ML into their methods, but in vastly different ways. While the OR community primarily
  relies on simplistic ML methods, the ML community generally uses deep learning,
  but fails to outperform OR baselines. To address this gap, the <em>EURO Meets NeurIPS
  2022 Vehicle Routing Competition</em> brought together the OR and ML communities
  as a joint effort of several previous competitions to solve a challenging VRP variant
  on real-world data provided by ORTEC, a leading provider of vehicle routing software.
  The challenge focuses on both a "classic" deterministic VRP with time windows (VRPTW)
  and a dynamic version in which new orders arrive over the course of a day. Over
  50 teams submitted solutions over a 13-week submission period, battling for not
  only the best performance on the competition problems, but also for the longest
  dominance of the leaderboard. The goals of the competition were achieved, with both
  state-of-the-art techniques in OR and ML playing a significant role in several of
  the winning submissions.
