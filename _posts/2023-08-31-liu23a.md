title: 'The NeurIPS 2022 Neural MMO Challenge: A Massively Multiagent Competition
  with Specialization and Trade'
abstract: In this paper, we present the results of the NeurIPS-2022 Neural MMO Challenge,
  which attracted 500 participants and received over 1,600 submissions. Like the previous
  IJCAI-2022 Neural MMO Challenge, it involved agents from 16 populations surviving
  in procedurally generated worlds by collecting resources and defeating opponents.
  This yearâ€™s competition runs on the latest v1.6 Neural MMO, which introduces new
  equipment, combat, trading, and a better scoring system. These elements combine
  to pose additional robustness and generalization challenges not present in previous
  competitions. This paper summarizes the design and results of the challenge, explores
  the potential of this environment as a benchmark for learning methods, and presents
  some practical reinforcement learning training approaches for complex tasks with
  sparse rewards. Additionally, we have open-sourced our baselines, including environment
  wrappers, benchmarks, and visualization tools for future research.
