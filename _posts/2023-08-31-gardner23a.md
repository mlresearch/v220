title: The Machine Reconnaissance Blind Chess Tournament of NeurIPS 2022
abstract: Reconnaissance Blind Chess is a game that plays like regular chess but rather
  than continuously observing the entire board, each player can only momentarily and
  privately observe selected board regions.  It has imperfect information and little
  common knowledge.  The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (the
  game’s creator) and several partners organized the third NeurIPS machine Reconnaissance
  Blind Chess competition in 2022 to bring people together to attempt to tackle research
  challenges presented by the game.  18 bots played each other in 9,180 games (60
  matches per bot pair) over 4 days.  The top bot exceeded the performance of all
  of last year’s bots yet a practical, sound (unexploitable) algorithm remains unknown.
