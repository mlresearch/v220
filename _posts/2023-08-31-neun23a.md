title: 'Traffic4cast at NeurIPS 2022 – Predict Dynamics along Graph Edges from Sparse
  Node Data: Whole City Traffic and ETA from Stationary Vehicle Detectors'
abstract: The global trends of urbanization and increased personal mobility force
  us to rethink the way we live and use urban space. The Traffic4cast competition
  series tackles this problem in a data-driven way, advancing the latest methods in
  machine learning for modeling complex spatial systems over time. In this edition,
  our dynamic road graph data combine information from road maps, $10^{12}$ probe
  data points, and stationary vehicle detectors in three cities over the span of two
  years. While stationary vehicle detectors are the most accurate way to capture traffic
  volume, they are only available in few locations.  Traffic4cast 2022 explores models
  that have the ability to generalize loosely related temporal vertex data on just
  a few nodes to predict dynamic future traffic states on the edges of the entire
  road graph.  In the core challenge, participants are invited to predict the likelihoods
  of three congestion classes derived from the speed levels in the GPS data for the
  entire road graph in three cities 15 min into the future. We only provide vehicle
  count data from spatially sparse stationary vehicle detectors in these three cities
  as model input for this task. The data are aggregated in 15 min time bins for one
  hour prior to the prediction time. For the extended challenge, participants are
  tasked to predict the average travel times on super-segments 15 min into the future
  – super-segments are longer sequences of road segments in the graph.  The competition
  results provide an important advance in the prediction of complex city-wide traffic
  states just from publicly available sparse vehicle data and without the need for
  large amounts of real-time floating vehicle data.
