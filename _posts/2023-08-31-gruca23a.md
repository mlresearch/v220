title: 'Weather4cast at NeurIPS 2022: Super-Resolution Rain Movie Prediction under
  Spatio-temporal Shifts'
abstract: 'Weather4cast again advanced modern algorithms in AI and machine learning
  through a highly topical interdisciplinary competition challenge: The prediction
  of hi-res rain radar movies from multi-band satellite sensors, requiring data fusion,
  multi-channel video frame prediction, and super-resolution. Accurate predictions
  of rain events are becoming ever more critical, with climate change increasing the
  frequency of unexpected rainfall. The resulting models will have a particular impact
  where costly weather radar is not available. We here present highlights and insights
  emerging from the thirty teams participating from over a dozen countries.  To extract
  relevant patterns, models were challenged by spatio-temporal shifts.  Geometric
  data augmentation and test-time ensemble models with a suitable smoother loss helped
  this transfer learning. Even though, in ablation, static information like geographical
  location and elevation was not linked to performance, the general success of models
  incorporating physics in this competition suggests that approaches combining machine
  learning with application domain knowledge seem a promising avenue for future research.
  Weather4cast will continue to explore the powerful benchmark reference data set
  introduced here, advancing competition tasks to quantitative predictions, and exploring
  the effects of metric choice on model performance and qualitative prediction properties.'
