title: 'MyoChallenge 2022: Learning contact-rich manipulation using a musculoskeletal
  hand'
abstract: 'Manual dexterity has been considered one of the critical components for
  human evolution. The ability to perform movements as simple as holding and rotating
  an object in the hand without dropping it needs the coordination of more than 35
  muscles which act synergistically or antagonistically on multiple joints. This complexity
  in control is markedly different from typical pre-specified movements or torque
  based controls used in robotics. In the MyoChallenge at the NeurIPS 2022 competition
  track, we challenged the community to develop controllers for a realistic hand to
  solve a series of dexterous manipulation tasks. The MyoSuite framework was used
  to train and test controllers on realistic, contact rich and computation efficient
  virtual neuromusculoskeletal model of the hand and wrist. Two tasks were proposed:
  a die re-orientation and a boading ball (rotation of two spheres respect to each
  other) tasks. More than 40 teams participated to the challenge and submitted more
  than 340 solutions. The challenge was split in two phases. In the first phase, where
  a limited set of objectives and randomization were proposed, teams managed to achieve
  high performance, in particular in the boading-ball task.  In the second phase as
  the focus shifted towards generalization of task solutions to extensive variations
  of object and task properties, teams saw significant performance drop. This shows
  that there is still a large gap in developing agents capable of generalizable skilled
  manipulation. In future challenges, we will continue pursuing the generalizability
  both in skills and agility of the tasks exploring additional realistic neuromusculoskeletal
  models.'
