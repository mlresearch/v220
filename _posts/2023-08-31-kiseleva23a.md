title: 'Interactive Grounded Language Understanding in a Collaborative Environment:
  Retrospective on Iglu 2022 Competition'
abstract: 'Human intelligence possesses the extraordinary ability to adapt rapidly
  to new tasks and multi-modal environments. This capacity emerges at an early age,
  as humans acquire new skills and learn to solve problems by imitating others or
  following natural language instructions. To facilitate research in this area, we
  recently hosted the second \emph{IGLU: Interactive Grounded Language Understanding
  in a Collaborative Environment} competition. The primary objective of the competition
  is to address the challenge of creating interactive agents that can learn to solve
  complex tasks by receiving grounded natural language instructions in a collaborative
  environment. Given the complexity of this challenge, we divided it into two sub-tasks:
  first, deciding whether the provided grounded instruction requires clarification,
  and second, following a clear grounded instruction to complete the task description.'
