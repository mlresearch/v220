title: 'NL4Opt Competition: Formulating Optimization Problems Based on Their Natural
  Language Descriptions'
abstract: 'The Natural Language for Optimization (NL4Opt) Competition was created
  to investigate methods of extracting the meaning and formulation of an optimization
  problem based on its text description. Specifically, the goal of the competition
  is to increase the accessibility and usability of optimization solvers by allowing
  non-experts to interface with them using natural language. We separate this challenging
  goal into two sub-tasks: (1) recognize and label the semantic entities that correspond
  to the components of the optimization problem; (2) generate a meaning representation
  (i.e. a logical form) of the problem from its detected problem entities. The first
  task aims to reduce ambiguity by detecting and tagging the entities of the optimization
  problems. The second task creates an intermediate representation of the linear programming
  (LP) problem that is converted into a format that can be used by commercial solvers.
  In this report, we present the LP word problem dataset and shared tasks for the
  NeurIPS 2022 competition. Furthermore, we present the winning solutions. Through
  this competition, we hope to bring interest towards the development of novel machine
  learning applications and datasets for optimization modeling.'
