title: Retrospective on the SENSORIUM 2022 competition
abstract: The neural underpinning of the biological visual system is challenging to
  study experimentally, in particular as neuronal activity becomes increasingly nonlinear
  with respect to visual input. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can serve a variety
  of goals for improving our understanding of this complex system, not only serving
  as predictive digital twins of sensory cortex for novel hypothesis generation in
  silico, but also incorporating bio-inspired architectural motifs to progressively
  bridge the gap between biological and machine vision. The mouse has recently emerged
  as a popular model system to study visual information processing, but no standardized
  large-scale benchmark to identify state-of-the-art models of the mouse visual system
  has been established. To fill this gap, we proposed the SENSORIUM benchmark competition.
  We collected a large-scale dataset from mouse primary visual cortex containing the
  responses of more than 28,000 neurons across seven mice stimulated with thousands
  of natural images, together with simultaneous behavioral measurements that include
  running speed, pupil dilation, and eye movements. The benchmark challenge ranked
  models based on predictive performance for neuronal responses on a held-out test
  set, and included two tracks for model input limited to either stimulus only (SENSORIUM)
  or stimulus plus behavior (SENSORIUM+). As a part of the NeurIPS 2022 competition
  track, we received 172 model submissions from 26 teams, with the winning teams improving
  our previous state-of-the-art model by more than 15 percent. Dataset access and
  infrastructure for evaluation of model predictions will remain online as an ongoing
  benchmark. We would like to see this as a starting point for regular challenges
  and data releases, and as a standard tool for measuring progress in large-scale
  neural system identification models of the mouse visual system and beyond.
