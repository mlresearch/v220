title: The Trojan Detection Challenge
abstract: Neural trojan attacks inject machine learning systems with hidden behavior
  that lies dormant until activated. In recent years, trojan detection has emerged
  as a promising avenue for defending against standard trojan attacks. However, there
  have been few investigations on trojans specifically designed to be difficult to
  detect. We organized the Trojan Detection Challenge to begin work on the important
  question of how to build more robust trojan detectors. This paper gives an overview
  of the competition and its results. Notably, participants greatly improved over
  strong baselines on trojan detection and reverse-engineering tasks, demonstrating
  the potential for proactively improving the robustness of trojan detectors. We hope
  the competition and its results will inspire further research in detecting hidden
  behavior in machine learning systems.
