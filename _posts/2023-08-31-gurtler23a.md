title: 'Real Robot Challenge 2022: Learning Dexterous Manipulation from Offline Data
  in the Real World'
abstract: Experimentation on real robots is demanding in terms of time and costs.
  For this reason, a large part of the reinforcement learning (RL) community uses
  simulators to develop and benchmark algorithms. However, insights gained in simulation
  do not necessarily translate to real robots, in particular for tasks involving complex
  interactions with the environment. The <em>Real Robot Challenge 2022</em> therefore
  served as a bridge between the RL and robotics communities by allowing participants
  to experiment remotely with a <em>real</em> robot - as easily as in simulation.  In
  the last years, offline reinforcement learning has matured into a promising paradigm
  for learning from pre-collected datasets, alleviating the reliance on expensive
  online interactions. We therefore asked the participants to learn two dexterous
  manipulation tasks involving pushing, grasping, and in-hand orientation from provided
  real-robot datasets. An extensive software documentation and an initial stage based
  on a simulation of the real set-up made the competition particularly accessible.
  By giving each team plenty of access budget to evaluate their offline-learned policies
  on a cluster of seven identical real TriFinger platforms, we organized an exciting
  competition for machine learners and roboticists alike.  In this work we state the
  rules of the competition, present the methods used by the winning teams and compare
  their results with a benchmark of state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms on the
  challenge datasets.
