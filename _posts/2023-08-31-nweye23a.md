title: 'The CityLearn Challenge 2022: Overview, Results, and Lessons Learned'
abstract: The shift to renewable power sources and building electrification to decarbonize
  existing and emerging building stock present unique challenges for the power grid.
  Building loads and flexible resources e.g. batteries must be adequately managed
  simultaneously to unlock the full flexibility potential and reduce costs for all
  stakeholders. Simple control algorithms based on expert knowledge e.g. RBC, as well
  as, advanced control algorithms e.g. MPC and RLC can be utilized to intelligently
  manage flexible resources. The CityLearn Challenge is an opportunity to compete
  in investigating the potential of AI and distributed control systems to tackle multiple
  problems within the built-environment. The CityLearn Challenge 2022 is the third
  of its kind with the overall objective of crowd-sourcing generalizable control policies
  that improve energy, cost and environmental objectives by taking advantage of batteries
  for load shifting in a CityLearn digital twin of a real-world grid-interactive neighborhood.
  Highlighted here are the uniqueness of this third edition, baseline and top solutions,
  and lessons learned for future editions.
