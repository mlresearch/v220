title: 'VisDA 2022 Challenge: Domain Adaptation for Industrial Waste Sorting'
abstract: 'Label-efficient and reliable semantic segmentation is essential for many
  real-life applications, especially for industrial settings with high visual diversity,
  such as waste sorting. In industrial waste sorting, one of the biggest challenges
  is the extreme diversity of the input stream depending on factors like the location
  of the sorting facility, the equipment available in the facility, and the time of
  year, all of which significantly impact the composition and visual appearance of
  the waste stream. These changes in the data are called “visual domains”, and label-efficient
  adaptation of models to such domains is needed for successful semantic segmentation
  of industrial waste.  To test the abilities of computer vision models on this task,
  we present the \emph{VisDA 2022 Challenge on Domain Adaptation for Industrial Waste
  Sorting}. Our challenge incorporates a fully-annotated waste sorting dataset, ZeroWaste,
  collected from two real material recovery facilities in different locations and
  seasons, as well as a novel procedurally generated synthetic waste sorting dataset,
  SynthWaste. In this competition, we aim to answer two questions: 1) can we leverage
  domain adaptation techniques to minimize the domain gap? and 2) can synthetic data
  augmentation improve performance on this task and help adapt to changing data distributions?
  The results of the competition show that industrial waste detection poses a real
  domain adaptation problem, that domain generalization techniques such as augmentations,
  ensembling, etc., improve the overall performance on the unlabeled target domain
  examples, and that leveraging synthetic data effectively remains an open problem.
